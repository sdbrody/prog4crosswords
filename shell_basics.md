## File System Navigation
As mentioned, one of the primary purposes of the shell is dealing with files, so our first step is to learn the commands that will help navigate the file system.

### Orientation - the home directory
As mentioned earlier, the directory you are currently in is shown in the command prompt, between the **:** and the **$** signs.
When you open the terminal program, you will start off in your "home" directory, which is represented by the shorthand **~** character.
You can display the contents of your current directory using the `ls` command. This will show you all the files and subdirectories
in your current directory. On most systems, directories and different file types each have distinct colors.

Typing `ls` followed by a subdirectory will list the contents of that subdirectory.
For a detailed list, with one entry per line use `ls -l`. The list of words appearing after the name of the program are called _arguments_. The `-l` argument is only one of many options available for `ls`. We will not go into the others in this tutorial, but ...

>  üìù You can get a description and list of options for *any shell command* by typing that command followed by `--help` or preceded by `man` (both with a space between).
> For example: `ls --help` or `man ls`. However, these manual-style pages (`man` is short for "manual") can be a little tricky for beginners.
> Googling something like "tutorial for ls command" is often helpful.

The home directory is usually also the one shown when you open your computer's file manager program.
You might find it useful to open it and compare what you see there with what you see with the `ls -l` command.  

### Moving Around
You can move between directories by using the `cd` (change directory) command. For instance, if you have see a **Downloads** subdirectory when running `ls`, you can try `cd Downloads`. Notice how the last part of your prompt changes from `:~$` to `:~/Downloads$` to reflect your current location. 

You can type `ls` again to list any files and subdirectories. To move one step back up the directory tree (i.e. to this directory's parent), use `cd ..`.

You can also specify a full path as an argument to `cd`. For example, if you entered the command `cd Downloads`, and then wanted to go to a different (sibling) subdirectory in your home directory named `Docs`, you could enter `cd ..` and then `cd Docs`, or `cd ../Docs` or `cd ~/Docs`.

### Creating and Deleting Files and Directories
To make a new directory under the current one, enter `mkdir` followed by the desired name. You can also specify a relative or absolute path as the argument, however, the parent directory for the new one you are creating has to already exist. 

Since this is a tutorial for beginners, I will skip the topic of deleting files and directories from the shell. This can be done easily and more safely from the graphical file manager, which has safeguards and recovery features.

### Reading and Writing Text Files

### Ctrl-C and Ctrl-X

#### cat: print out text file(s)
To print out text files, use the `cat` command followed by a list of the file names (or just a single file). `cat` is short for "contcatinate", since it will print out the contents of the files, in order, joined together.

#### echo: print a piece of text (string)
The `echo` command, followed by a list of strings will simply print those words to the screen. Since some characters (e.g., **;**, **(**, **)**, **-**) have special meaning, as we will see in the next section, it's good practice to put your desired output inside double quotes. For example `echo "What's your name?"` will print correctly, whereas `echo What's your name?` will not.

There are many subtlties 



cat, echo, head, tail, less, nano
; and ()
